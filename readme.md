# ChatGPT hallucinates and is not to be trusted

I was using the [KOFI method](https://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_ultimate_spanish_conjugation.php) of learning spanish verb conjugations as a way to better understand not just how to conjugate verbs into their tenses but when to actually use them and create patterns in my head. The deck is great, but the problem is it's not real world examples.

I've had great success in the past with just translating sentences and being able to somewhat extrapolate the words in the sentences to other sentences. AKA, I just need more real world examples. I wrote this basic ChatGPT script to give me a bunch of sample example sentences of conjugated verbs.

I saw an article somewhere listing which tenses are most commonly used and focused on those, however it's important to have extras. The words chosen are purely from the KOFI list, please add or remove them as you see fit.

The ChatGPT output isn't perfect and you'll have to go into the created csv and remove any non formatted sentences. I chose not to troubleshoot this as the basic prompt I'm using had difficulty doing a lot of things and I didn't want to overwhelm it. The goal was to have it focus on the sentences so hopefully those turn out as correct as possible
